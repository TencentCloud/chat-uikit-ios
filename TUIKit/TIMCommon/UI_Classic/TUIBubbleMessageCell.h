 *  This document declares the TUIBubbleMessageCell class.
 *  Bubble messages, the most common type of messages that contain strings and emoticons.
 *  Both TUIFileMessageCell and TUIVoiceMessageCell inherit from this class and implement the userinterface of bubble messages.
 *  If developers want to customize the bubble message, they can also refer to the implementation methods of the above two message units to implement their own
 * bubble message unit.
